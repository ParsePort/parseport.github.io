_This page is a test for how we can structure our documentation. We expect to have everything ready in the new year (2020)._


## Documentation
The documentation for Parseport consists of four parts, the source code, test code with test reports, Swagger documentation and this web page.

### This documentation page
The documentation written at this page, will be updated to reflect any changes. The documentation is stored in version control, which mean we can restore old documentation, and compare the changes. If you need more documentation, which is not part of this page, then please contact CTO Emil  Holmegaard [emil.holmegaard@parseport.com](mailto:emil.holmegaard@parseport.com).

### Swagger.io
The ParsePort solution has full Swagger documentation. You can find the swagger documentation at [https://xbrlapi.parseport.com](https://xbrlapi.parseport.com)

### Test coverage
Test coverage reports can be found at [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gh/ParsePort/). You will need full access to ParsePort GitHub repositories, to access the test coverage reports.
