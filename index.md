_This page is a test for how we can structure our documentation. We expect to have everything ready in the new year (2020)._


## Documentation
The documentation for Parseport consists of four parts, the source code, test code with test reports, Swagger documentation and this web page.

### This documentation page
The documentation written at this page, will be updated to reflect any changes. The documentaiton is stored in version control, whcih mean we can restore old documentation, and compare the changes. If you need more documentation, whcih is not part of this page, then please contact CTO Emil Holmegaard [emil.holmegaard@parseport.com](mailto:emil.holmegaard@parseport.com), then he will provide what is needed.

### Swagger.io
The solution has full Swagger documentation. You can find the sqwagger documentation at [https://xbrlapi.parseport.com](https://xbrlapi.parseport.com)

### Test coverage
Test coverage reports can be found at [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gh/ParsePort/). You will need full access to the GitHub repositories, to be able to access the test coverage reports.
