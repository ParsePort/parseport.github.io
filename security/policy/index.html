At the same time, these persons are responsible for any third parties being permitted access to the equipment to comply with this policy when using the equipment.</p> <h2 id="common-techincal-security-measures"> <a href="#common-techincal-security-measures" aria-labelledby="common-techincal-security-measures" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Common techincal security measures </h2> <p>ParsePort’s network must always be based on standard protocols. Protocol selection is made by the IT manager. When changing the protocol, the external adviser must give their recommendation as well as help elucidate fall groups, sources of error, etc.</p> <p>The infrastructure must be up-to-date at all times and secured by the IT manager. The work is done under the direction of the Executive Board, and possibly through the assistance of an external competence advisor.</p> <p>The infrastructure must be reviewed once a year, in the context of planning the annual IT strategy plan.</p> <h2 id="suppliers-service-og-repair"> <a href="#suppliers-service-og-repair" aria-labelledby="suppliers-service-og-repair" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Suppliers, service og repair </h2> <p>Servers and PCs should be installed with standard basic software that can be serviced by general IT vendors, unless there are significant reasons for otherwise.</p> <p>In order to ensure the easiest possible approach to complaints cases and remedying errors, the number of suppliers should be limited as far as possible.</p> <p>When equipment with built-in storage media such as PCs, servers and mobile devices is handed over to a third party, it must comply with ParsePort’s IT security rules. If the device contains company data and the storage medium is not encrypted, this must be done or the storage media removed.</p> <h3 id="security-requirements-for-suppliers"> <a href="#security-requirements-for-suppliers" aria-labelledby="security-requirements-for-suppliers" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Security requirements for suppliers </h3> <p>ParsePort sets security requirements for IT vendors that must be met.</p> <p>Any IT vendor must comply with this IT security policy. At the same time, user rights management and control, physical security and regular backup routines of hardware and software are expected to be established. In addition, the systems must be protected by technologies and measures that limit the risk of attacks against systems operated on behalf of ParsePort. Technologies include, for example, firewall and antivirus, while measures can be active logging and policies enforced on the systems.</p> <p>In addition, ParsePort assumes that the supplier proactively monitors the outsourced equipment and other systems that may affect the operation and stability of solutions provided by the supplier on behalf of ParsePort. The scope of requirements for the supplier may vary depending on the type of service being outsourced. As there may be different SLAs and terms, refer to the individual contracts signed with the supplier.</p> <h2 id="it-equipment"> <a href="#it-equipment" aria-labelledby="it-equipment" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> IT-equipment </h2> <p>IT equipment must be approved by the IT manager and may only be used as long as the product continues to have an active life cycle in the form of software and hardware updates.</p> <h2 id="backups"> <a href="#backups" aria-labelledby="backups" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Backups </h2> <p>All internal infrastructure components and customer-facing systems must be backed up on an ongoing basis.

All viruses known by the program are scanned for all relevant files.</p> <p>The log of the antivirus program is continuously monitored by the IT manager. Initially, it is impossible to provide adequate guidelines for viruses and virus attacks, but ParsePort continuously uses external IT security company with technical experience in incident and forensic handling to minimize damage and downtime and isolate the incident as quickly as possible. If, as an end user, it is suspected that the PC has received a virus, all tasks on the system must be canceled. The PC is isolated from the network and the IT manager is contacted.</p> <p>All PCs and servers must have a valid antivirus program installed. ParsePort’s internal network is protected by firewall and is isolated from other networks, only with access from the Global Connect internal zone from which the base infrastructure is operated. All zones at Global Connect are protected by both firewall and intrusion prevention system.</p> <p>Apart from firewall protection, all infrastructure located at Global Connect is also protected with the Intrusion Prevention System for additional protection.</p> <p>To ensure impartial testing of the systems, external penetration tests are performed at least once a year for all zones where ParsePort has equipment at Global Connect.</p> <p>Software to bypass system and application controls may only be used by professional security consultants and solely for the purpose of securing the systems. Furthermore, these must not be used without the written consent of the Executive Board and the IT manager.</p> <h2 id="data-persistence"> <a href="#data-persistence" aria-labelledby="data-persistence" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Data persistence </h2> <p>There are two locations for data storage, depending on whether the data storage is for ParsePort’s internal infrastructure or for ParsePort’s customer-facing software (product).</p> <p>Both ParsePort’s internal and customer-facing IT systems are located at Global Connect in a professional ISAE 3402 approved as well as ISO 27001 and ISO 9001 certified data center on an IaaS platform.

OneDrive is the only place that stores internal data. Furthermore, MFA is enabled for all services, used within ParsePorts domain. The XBRL service, is the manuel XBRL convertion, is performed on a Microsoft Remote Desktop solution, to ensure a minimal attack surface.

Using Add-in, the data file is transferred via TLS 1.2 to ParsePort’s systems, after which the system converts / processes it and returns an XBRL file with data.</li> <li>API interface, for use by customers’ own programs / software. So that the customer can embed the logic of ParsePort into their own applications or API supporting software. The API interface is used by the customer’s solution calling ParsePorts API via TLS 1.2 with a key, as well as data for conversion / processing. ParsePort’s system then returns the XBRL file of data.</li> </ol> <h2 id="system-availability"> <a href="#system-availability" aria-labelledby="system-availability" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> System Availability </h2> <p>The system is accessible from all over the Internet and is protected according to the two sections “Technical safety” and “Physical security”.</p> <h2 id="data-security"> <a href="#data-security" aria-labelledby="data-security" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Data security </h2> <p>All communication with the production system must be encrypted during transport over the internet minimum according to the TLS 1.2 standard (RFC 5246).</p> <p>All data stored in the production system must be segmented in a way that it is not possible for customers on the platform to access each other’s data.</p> <hr> <footer> <p class="text-small text-grey-dk-000 mb-0">Copyright &copy; 2020 ParsePort.</p> </footer> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
